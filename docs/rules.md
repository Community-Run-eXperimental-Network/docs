## The no's

	* No conducting of illegal activities
	* If you don't get the point, don't do illegal stuff

* No pornography

* Don't maliciously attack someone's infra

* No piracy

## The yes's

* Free speech
	* We all get offended from time to time but it's not worth stopping bad opinions
	* It's also, on the other hand, nice to not a be a dick though (social consequences are there still)

## Lastly...

We really don't want the scum of internet degeneracy on here (see first subpoint of first point in "The no's" section).
