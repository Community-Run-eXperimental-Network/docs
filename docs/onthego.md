CRXN On-the-go
==============

If you don't want to have to setup your **own router** or if you are away from a router itself and don't want to run one directly on your laptop and peer with someone then you can make use of someone else's router. A user, _caskd_, has made this possible. He provides IPv6-only and clearnet VPN tunneling over Wireguard - giving you access to all of IPv6 CRXN easily on Android, iOS or Linux, Mac OSX or Windows (any platform that Wireguard supports).
