# How to connect to CRXN with wireguard and systemd-networkd

1) Generate the private key:

```
wg genkey | sudo tee /etc/systemd/network/crxn0-private.key
chmod 600 /etc/systemd/network/crxn0-private.key
```

2) Get the public key from it (you will need to send that to deavmi):

```
sudo cat /etc/systemd/network/crxn0-private.key | wg pubkey
```

3) Configure a new wireguard device:

```
sudo cat > /etc/systemd/network/crxn0.netdev <<EOF
[NetDev]
Name = crxn0
Kind = wireguard
Description = wg peering with crxn over yggdrasil

[WireGuard]
PrivateKeyFile = /etc/systemd/network/crxn0-private.key
ListenPort = 51820

[WireGuardPeer]
PublicKey = e0zNJwCyP+sD5oiF0QAkzrM3rJpmg1NeGxEHVCfBClM=
AllowedIPs = fd00::/8
Endpoint = [301:754:2ca2:57f8::1]:51820
EOF
```

4) Create the crxn network configuration file:

```
sudo cat > /etc/systemd/network/20-crxn0.network <<EOF
[Match]
Name=crxn0

[Network]
IPv6AcceptRA=false

[Address]
## Uncomment and change this to your IP address
# Address=fdf1:1dc1:f54d:0001::1/64 # CHANGE THIS !!!!
## Uncomment to route packets from another interface, ie eth0
# AddPrefixRoute=false

[Route]
Destination=fd00::/8
EOF
```

5) Restart the service to apply all settings:

```
sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd
```
