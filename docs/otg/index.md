CRXN _On-the-go_ ™️
==================

CRXN _On-the-go_ are a collection of services run by a few people on CRXN that have decided to lease out client-only access (meaning no bird, no routing) access to CRXN via one of their routers. Normally this will be in the form of a Wireguard endpoint that they make available to you.

So far we have two people offering such services:

1. [Deavmi's OTG](deavmi.md)
2. [Rany's OTG](rany.md)
