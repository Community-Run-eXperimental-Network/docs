Radv
====

Radv or _Router advertisements_ is a feature Bird offers that can allow you to add an additional configuration to your Bird router such that you
can have it automatically configure your host devices on your CRXN /48 LAN such that they can access the LAN, the greater CRXN and also possibly
configure [CRXN DNS](../dns) too!

There are tutorials for both:

1. [Bird 1.6](bird1.6_radv.md)
2. [Bird 2.0](bird2_radv.md)
